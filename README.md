# work-day-scheduler

## Description
A work day scheduler to plan your work day! Set times from 9am to 5pm. You enter your events in the text area then press the save button to save it locally. Even if you refresh, your saved events will remain in the corresponding time block. Each time block will be colorcoded depending on the current hour. If it is in the past, the time block will be grey. If it is in the future, it will be green. If it's the current hour, it will be red.

Currently, there is a minor bug where the color will stretch past the button.

## Installation
